# ðŸš€JET Server Pack
Server package for the Minecraft JET modpack

### How to use?
**1.** Download the version you want to use from the [Releases](https://github.com/UeberallGebannt/jet-server-pack/releases) tab.
You can either select Forge or Crucible depending if you need bukkit plugins or just want to use plain Forge.

**2.** Put all files from the ZIP file in a folder and run the `startserver.bat` or `startserver.sh` script depending on your operating system.

**3.** Wait until the server is installed and startet. Setup any files you want to modify and stop the server so it will restart automatically.

### Important!

This server restarts automatically after 10 seconds. If you want to stop the server, type `stop` into the console and press `ctrl` and `c` during the cooldown.

This server pack contains a [modifed version](https://github.com/UeberallGebannt/ServerStarter) of the TeamAOF [ServerStarter](https://github.com/TeamAOF/ServerStarter).
